# OpenACH Origination Platform

OpenACH is a free, open-source, secure web-based ACH origination and 
payment processing platform.  For more information, visit 
[openach.com](http://openach.com/)


## INSTALLATION

OpenACH is tested and runs on a Linux/Apache/PHP stack, with either 
Postgresql or SQLite as a database backend.  It is built on the [Yii
1.0 framework](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii), so installation is
similar to a standard Yii 1.0 app.

The release contains the following directories:

      assets/              auto-published CSS and Javascript assets
      css/                 global CSS files
      images/              global images
      js/                  global js files
      legal/               license information
      protected/           the core application, on the Yii framework
      themes/              the OpenACH Yii theme
      yii                  a symbolic link to the latest Yii 1.0 framework
      index.php            the main entry point for the framework
      README.md            this file
      UPGRADE              upgrading instructions


## REQUIREMENTS

The minimum requirement for OpenACH is that your Web server supports
PHP 5.3, and has been tested on PHP 5.5.  Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and 
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS make great platforms for running an OpenACH
system.


## QUICK START

### Docker
[Docker](http://docker.io) is a platform for developers and sysadmins 
to develop, ship, and run applications. Docker lets you quickly 
assemble applications from components and eliminates the friction that 
can come when shipping code. Docker lets you get your code tested and 
deployed into production as fast as possible.

Docker can run on a wide variety of platforms. Visit the 
[Docker.io](http://docker.io) website to learn how to install Docker 
on your system. NOTE: To most easily access the OpenACH command line 
interface (CLI), you will need Docker 1.3 or higher.

To get started using the Docker OpenACH image, see the instructions 
here: [OpenACH Docker Image](https://github.com/openach/docker-openach

### The OpenACH CLI
OpenACH comes with a command line tool, based on the "yiic" CLI, which
you can use to perform nearly all the admin functions.  See the 
[OpenACH CLI Documentation](http://openach.com/books/openach-cli-documentation/openach-cli-documentation) 
for more information.
